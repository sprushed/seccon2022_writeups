This time, control flow goes into if of `__detect_debugger` which do some control flow obfuscation by executing invalid instructions and handling sigsegvs on each of that instructions. This way, instead of going to main, it goes to symbol named `heart` which contains obfuscated generation of key and sbox for twine cipher. After that, there is encryption of flag with blocks of 8 bytes each, and after that it checks with valid encrypted flag. While on ctf, I reversed twine cipher by myself, because I didn't know about it. Unfortunately, original solver script is lost :(
